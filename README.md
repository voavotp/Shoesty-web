"# Shoesty" 
shoesty is a marketplace used for creating listings by their users, so that other users can contact them through email.

Create an account through signup, then either search on the main page for a specific shoe or go to the shoe page to see all the shoes available.
If a user wants to upload their own listing, they go on the user page, click create new shoe and fill in the necessary information.( if you make a mistake you can delete or edit the shoe.)

note: the shoe created is saved through the email since this is how users will communicate.
